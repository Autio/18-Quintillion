Fonts for Frontier

-Sources

The Brisk font originates from Jades' FFE Site and can also
be downloaded there: http://www.jades.org/ffe.htm

The Frontier Fonts originate from the FFE Music website and
are also available there: http://www.dream-ware.co.uk/

-Installing fonts

Simply unzip the three font files into your windows/fonts directory, and
they will then appear like all other fonts you have installed, and websites
that use these fonts (such as the above) will then be displayed just as
the author intended.
